# Introduction

This app was adapted from a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/). It's a plant shop, built with a custom Node server, Express and html templates. Node modules provide functionality, including the ability to set cookies so users can add items to a cart without having to sign in as well as form validation. Encryption also allows admins to securely create an account, add products and upload images. All product data, users, shopping carts and product images are stored in JSON files.

# Technologies
* Node v14.8.0
